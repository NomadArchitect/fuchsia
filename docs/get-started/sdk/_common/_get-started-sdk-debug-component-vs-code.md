Start the Fuchsia debugger ([`zxdb`][fuchsia-debugger]) in VS Code and debug
the sample component, which is now  updated to crash when it runs.

The tasks include:

- Configure a debugging profile in VS Code.
- Set a breakpoint in the source code.
- Start the Fuchsia debugger.
- Step through the code.

In VS Code, do the following:

1. Click the "Run and Debug" icon on the left side of the VS Code window.

   src="/docs/reference/tools/editors/vscode/images/extensions/ext-start-debug.png">

1. Click the **Show all automatic debug configurations** link.

   This opens the Command Palette and displays a list of debugging
   profiles.

1. In the Command Palette, click
   **Add Config (fuchsia-getting-started)...**.

1. Click **zxdb**.

   This opens the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

1. Update this `launch.json` file to the following configuration:

   ```json5 {:.devsite-disable-click-to-copy}
   {
     "configurations": [
       {
         "name": "{{ '<strong>' }}Fuchsia getting started{{ '</strong>' }}",
         "type": "zxdb",
         "request": "launch",
         "launchCommand": "{{ '<strong>' }}tools/bazel run --config=fuchsia_x64 src/hello_world:pkg.component{{ '</strong>' }}",
         "process": "{{ '<strong>' }}hello_world{{ '</strong>' }}"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   This configuration is set to start the `hello_world`
   component and attach the debugger to it.

1. To save the file, press `CTRL+S` (or `CMD+S` on macOS)

1. Click the Explorer icon on the left side of the VS Code window.

1. Open the `src/hello_world/hello_world.cc` file.

1. To set a breakpoint at the `main()` method, click the space left to
   the line number.

   alt="This figure shows the Run and Debug option of VS Code."

   When a breakpoint is set, a red dot appears.

1. At the top of the **Run and Debug** panel, select the
   **Fuchsia getting started** debugging profile.

1. Click the play icon to run the debugger.

   <img class="vscode-image vscode-image-center"
   alt="This figure shows a line of code that is highlighted by the Debugger."
   src="images/get-started-vscode-debugger-highlight.png">

   This builds and runs the `hello_world` component, which causes
   the debugger to pause the execution at the line where the
   breakpoint is set in the `src/hello_world/hello_world.cc` file.

1. Click the **DEBUG CONSOLE** tab on the VS Code window.

   alt="This figure shows the debug console."
   src="images/get-started-vscode-debug-console.png">

   This shows the console output of the Fuchsia debugger (`zxdb`).

1. Click the **FUCHISA LOGS** tab on the VS Code window.

1. In the **Filter logs...** text box, type `hello_world` and press **Enter**.

   You may see entries for `Hello, World!` and `Hello again, World!` from
   the previous sections. However, you can ignore those previous entries.
   Take note of the most recent lines in the logs.

1. In the debug toolbar at the top of the VS Code window,
   click the continue icon.

   <img class="vscode-image vscode-image-center"
   alt="This figure shows the continue button of the debug toolbar."
   src="images/get-started-vscode-debug-continue.png">

1. In the **FUCHSIA LOGS** panel, verify that a new `Hello again, World!`
   entry is printed in the logs.

1. To exit the debugger, click the stop icon in the debug toolbar.
