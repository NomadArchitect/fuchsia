      The first cell should be 0 for SPI interrupts. All other values are reserved.

      The second cell is the interrupt number. Note that the interrupts are counted from
      the first SPI interrupt (vector 32).

      The third cell is the interrupt mode, as follows:
        bits[3:0] is the trigger type and level flags.
          1 = equivalent to ZX_INTERRUPT_MODE_EDGE_HIGH.
          2 = reserved.
          4 = equivalent to ZX_INTERRUPT_MODE_LEVEL_HIGH.
          8 = reserved.
        other bits are reserved.
