// A struct used as the context in many places in the driver that need to access device specific
// data. Among other things it's used as the context for moal callbacks but it's also used to pass
// around these common pointers that are used in many components without having to pass around
// multiple pointer or needing those components to be aware of the Device class and requiring that
// the Device class expose its internals.
//
// This should be placed in mlan_device->pmoal_handle by the bus level device. The intention is that
// the bus level device will extend this struct with bus specific data if needed and that Device
// will add on device specific data.
//
// Avoid placing interface related information here, this is only intended for things whose lifetime
// is tied to the Device instance. That way other parts of the code don't have to manage interface
// object lifetimes in multiple places.
