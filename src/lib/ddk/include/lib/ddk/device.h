//@ # The Device Protocol
//
// Device drivers implement a set of hooks (methods) to support the
// operations that may be done on the devices that they publish.
//
// These are described below, including the action that is taken
// by the default implementation that is used for each hook if the
// driver does not provide its own implementation.

typedef struct zx_protocol_device {
  //@ ## version
  // This field must be set to `DEVICE_OPS_VERSION`
  uint64_t version;

  //@ ## get_protocol
  // The get_protocol hook is called when a driver invokes
  // **device_get_protocol()** on a device object.  The implementation must
  // populate *protocol* with a protocol structure determined by *proto_id*.
  // If the requested *proto_id* is not supported, the implementation must
  // return ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED.
  //
  // The default get_protocol hook returns with *protocol*=*proto_ops* if *proto_id*
  // matches the one given when **device_add()** created the device, and returns
  // ZX_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED otherwise.
  //
  // See the **device_get_protocol()** docs for a description of the layout of
  // *protocol*.
  //
  // This hook is never called by the devhost runtime other than when
  // **device_get_protocol()** is invoked by some driver.  It is executed
  // synchronously in the same thread as the caller.
  zx_status_t (*get_protocol)(void* ctx, uint32_t proto_id, void* protocol);

  //@ ## init
  // The init hook is called when a device is initially added.
  //
  // If implemented, the device is guaranteed to be invisible and not able to be unbound until the
  // driver calls **device_init_reply()** on itself. **device_init_reply()** can be called from
  // any thread - it does not necessarily need to be called before the |init| hook returns.
  //
  // This allows drivers to safely complete initialization without explicit synchronization with
  // the unbind hook, such as adding device metadata or completing blocking operations in a
  // worker thread. Once the initialization is completed, **device_init_reply()** should be
  // called to make the device visible and able to be unbound.
  //
  // The hook is always called from the devhost's main thread.
  void (*init)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## unbind
  // The unbind hook is called to begin removal of a device (due to hot unplug, fatal error, etc).
  //
  // The driver should avoid further method calls to its parent device or any
  // protocols obtained from that device, and expect that any further such calls
  // will return with an error.
  //
  // The driver should adjust its state to encourage its client connections to close
  // (cause IO to error out, etc), and call **device_unbind_reply()** on itself when ready.
  // See the docs for **device_unbind_reply()** for important semantics.
  //
  // The driver must continue to handle all device hooks except for message, open, read, and write
  // until the **release** hook is invoked.
  //
  // Prior to unbind being called, the DDK will suspend processing of all FIDL messages and new
  // connections will be disallowed at this point. A device driver is responsible for ensuring that
  // any pending FIDL transactions are replied to or closed prior to replying to unbind. A device
  // which handles asynchronous FIDL messages *must* implement this hook.
  //
  // **Note:** This hook will not be called for a **device instance**.
  //
  // This is an optional hook (except for drivers that implement message). The default
  // implementation will be a hook that replies immediately with **device_unbind_reply()**.
  //
  // This hook will be called from the devhost's main thread. It will be executed sometime
  // after any of the following events occuring: **device_async_remove()** is invoked on the
  // device, the device's parent has completed its unbind hook via **device_unbind_reply**,
  // or a fuchsia.device.Controller/ScheduleUnbind request is received.
  void (*unbind)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## release
  // The release hook is called after this device has finished unbinding, all open client
  // connections of the device have been closed, and all child devices have been unbound and
  // released.
  //
  // At the point release is invoked, the driver will not receive any further calls
  // and absolutely must not use the underlying **zx_device_t** or any protocols obtained
  // from that device once this method returns.
  //
  // The driver must free all memory and release all resources related to this device
  // before returning.
  //
  // This hook may be called from any thread including the devhost's main
  // thread.
  void (*release)(void* ctx);

  //@ ## suspend
  // The suspend hook is used for suspending a device from a working to
  // non-working low power state(sleep state), or from a non-working sleep state
  // to a deeper sleep state.
  //
  // requested_state is always a non-working sleep state.
  // enable_wake is whether to configure the device for wakeup from the requested non
  // working sleep state. If enable_wake is true and the device does not support
  // wake up, the hook fails without suspending the device.
  // suspend_reason provides information for the driver why the suspend hook is called.
  // Bus drivers and platform drivers like acpi will find this information useful to
  // issue any system calls or save the reboot reason.
  //
  // The driver should put the device into the requested_state and call **device_suspend_reply()**
  // on itself. device_suspend_reply() will take in two parameters: status of the suspend operation
  // and an out_state. If status is success, the out_state is same as requested_state.
  // If status is failure, out_state is the low power state the device is currently in.
  //
  // This hook assumes that the drivers are aware of their current state. This hook will only
  // be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  void (*suspend)(void* ctx, uint8_t requested_state, bool enable_wake, uint8_t suspend_reason);

  //@ ## resume
  // The resume hook is used for resuming a device from a non-working sleep
  // state to a working state. It requires reinitializing the device completely
  // or partially depending on the sleep state that device was in, when the
  // resume call was made.
  //
  // requested_state is the performance state that the device has to be in.
  //
  // The driver should put the device into the requested_state and call **device_resume_reply()**
  // on itself. device_resume_reply() will take in the following parameters:
  // (1)Status of the resume operation (2)out_power_state (3) out_perf_state
  // On success, the device has been resumed successfully to a working state,
  // out_perf_state is same as requested state.
  // If the device is not able to resume to a working state, the hook returns a
  // failure. out_power_state has the non working state the device is in.
  // if out_power_state is a working state, out_perf_state has the performance
  // state the device is in.
  // This hook assumes that the drivers are aware of their current state.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  void (*resume)(void* ctx, uint32_t requested_state);

  //@ ## configure_autosuspend
  // The configure_autosuspend hook is used for configuring whether a driver can
  // auto suspend the device depending on the activity and idleness of the device.
  //
  // If "enable" is true, auto suspend is configured. deepest_sleep_state is the deepest
  // sleep state the device is expected to go into when the device is suspended.
  //
  // On success, the device is configured to be autosuspended
  // On failure, the device not configured to be autosuspended. If the device does
  // not implement the autosuspend hook, it means the device does not support autosuspend.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  //

  zx_status_t (*configure_auto_suspend)(void* ctx, bool enable, uint8_t deepest_sleep_state);

  //@ ## rxrpc
  // Only called for bus devices.
  // When the "shadow" of a busdev sends an rpc message, the
  // device that is shadowing is notified by the rxrpc op and
  // should attempt to read and respond to a single message on
  // the provided channel.
  //
  // Any error return from this method will result in the channel
  // being closed and the remote "shadow" losing its connection.
  //
  // This method is called with ZX_HANDLE_INVALID for the channel
  // when a new client connects -- at which point any state from
  // the previous client should be torn down.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  zx_status_t (*rxrpc)(void* ctx, zx_handle_t channel);

  //@ ## message
  // Process a FIDL rpc message. This is used to handle class or
  // device specific messaging.
  //
  // The entire message becomes the responsibility of the driver,
  // including the handles.
  //
  // The txn provided to respond to the message is only valid for
  // the duration of the message() call. It must not be retained
  // and used later.
  //
  // If this method wishes to respond asynchronously, the txn
  // should be copied.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
  void (*message)(void* ctx, fidl_incoming_msg_t msg, device_fidl_txn_t txn);

  //@ ## child_pre_release
  // The child_pre_release hook is used to signal that a child device
  // will soon be released. This is after the child and all its descendents
  // have been unbound and removed from the device filesystem, and all client
  // connections to the child have been closed.
  //
  // The device may want to drop any references to the child context or child
  // **zx_device_t**.
  //
  // This hook may be called from any thread including the devhost's main
  // thread.
  void (*child_pre_release)(void* ctx, void* child_ctx);

  // The made_visible hook is used to signal that the device has been made
  // visible in devfs. It can be used as a synchornization point to inform
  // clients that they may try and open the device.
  //
  // This hook will only be executed on the devhost's main thread.
