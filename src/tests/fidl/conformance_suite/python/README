# Bring-Up Testing for fidlgen_python

The fidlgen_python program for generating Python FIDL bindings is incomplete and
can only compile a subset of the test.conformance FIDL library. This directory
contains a GN target that builds a test.conformance.python FIDL library that is
a subset of test.conformance.

The test.conformance.python subset of test.conformance is created by running the
custom transplant_fidl build action on a subset of the .fidl files that define
the test.conformance FIDL library. The transplant_fidl build action works by
searching for the declared FIDL library in a .fidl file and substituting it with
another. This effectively transplants the FIDL definitions from one FIDL library
library into another. (This is technically somwehere between a transplant and a
clone. The word "transplant" felt more appropriate because only part of FIDL
library is being copied into another.)
