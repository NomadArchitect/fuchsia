"""Bazel platform() definitions for the Fuchsia platform build."""

# The Fuchsia build will use transitions that change the --platforms=<label>
# value to modify the current build configuration. As such, each platform
# instance represents:
#
#  - A separate output directory for generated artifacts.
#  - An execution environment for generated binaries.
#
# The `//build/bazel/platforms:common` platform is used for all targets
# that do not generate os- or arch-specific binaries (e.g. Java bytecode,
# auto-generated headers and more). It is set to be the default platforms
# by using --platforms=//build/bazel/platforms:common in the auto-generated
# .bazelrc
#
# In theory, it should be possible to define additionnal platforms that
# correspond to specific Fuchsia product configurations, which will allow
# performing system assembly for several Fuchsia devices in a single
# build invocation (provided the right transitions are used).
