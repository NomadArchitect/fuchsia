            when using the debugger.

            The source paths embedded in debug symbol files are usually relative. Historically, these
            were relative to the Ninja build directory (e.g. "../../src/foo/foo.cc"), which is why
            this is key is named 'build_dir' in files like symbol-index.json. In the context of

            name, which must be defined by Bazel when the action that registers debug symbols
            is run, such as BAZEL_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY (see Bazel user manual).

            If 'source_search_root' is a File pointing to a directory, the latter is used
